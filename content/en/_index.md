# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Cássio — a developer and aspiring cloud architect passionate about building reliable, automated, and scalable systems.
I've gained strong hands-on experience through personal and practical projects involving Linux servers, AWS, and Azure, using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and GitHub Actions to design CI/CD pipelines and manage infrastructure as code.
I enjoy working across the stack, coding primarily in Python, Go, and Bash, and applying DevOps and cloud-native principles to create environments that are efficient, consistent, and easy to maintain.

Take a look at my [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}})!
